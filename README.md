# Solar System Trivia Game

This Repo includes Timers, HTML, CSS, and jQuery elements that together, along with photos, work together to create a simple game. This game is called "Solar System Trivia." Upon loading the game, the user will see a question with 4 possible answers. The user has 20 seconds to answer; a timer will be counting down from 20 to inform the user of the time left. If the time runs out and the user hasn't selected an option, the options get greyed out, the solution is displayed, and a new timer starts counting down from 3 letting the user knows a new question will be displayed in 3 seconds.

The user will see a total of ten questions. For each question they get right, they get 1 point. If they get a question wrong, or if they skip a question, they get 0 points. After the last question is answered (or skipped), the player will see a new button appear that prompts the user for a click. Upon clicking this button, the user will see their report card and have the option to start the game from scratch...I did my best to document each step and label it clearly so that the code can (hopefully) be sensical at first glance.

Here's a quick overview of the project itself:

1. What the project does?

   Stated above: provides a fun and basic game written in jQuery and relying heavily on the use of timers.

2. Why the project is useful?

   This project provides the elementary building blocks to constructing JavaScript applications using jQuery and timers.

   It provides simple examples of what can be done with timers, functions, objects, for/while loops and "if" statements

   It also gives a glimpse into how the worlds of Timers, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery JavaScript come to work together in harmony

3. How users can get started with the project?

4. Where users can get help with your project?

   The project is fairly complicated with a lot of if/if else statements, but I added a ton of comments throughout the html, css, and js files that explain the steps taken

   Google, stackOverflow and W3schools are all great resources if the reader isn't familiar with some of the elements used throughout the codebase

   If you need further help, please feel free to reach out to me on GitHub
